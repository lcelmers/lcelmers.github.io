Had the unalloyed pleasure of teaching a summer study at Church of the Advent, Denver, with the incomparable Deacon Cindy Hamilton. Check out Advent's sermon feed for recordings of our lessons and practicums (July 1, 8, 15, + 22). The focus of this study was the Immanuel Approach to contemplative and relationally-connective prayer. Happy listening and God's peace!
